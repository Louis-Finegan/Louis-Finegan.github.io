## About me

I'm an Irish Master of Science student in Mathematical Science at [Maynooth University](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/), and earned my [Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Sciences](https://www.tudublin.ie/explore/faculties-and-schools/computing-digital-data/mathematics-and-statistics/news/the-class-of-2025-graduates.php) from [TU Dublin](https://www.tudublin.ie/). I explored areas such as, Cosmology, Quantum Field Theory, Fluid Mechanics, General Relativity, Statistics, Differential Equations, Numerical Analysis, and Machine Learning. I also dived into pure mathematics topics such as Ring and Field Theory, Group Theory, Differential Geometry and Real Analysis.

I'm passionate about learning and research in Applied Mathematics and Computing. I love traveling abroad, and I'm excited about the possibility of seeking international collaborations where I can apply mathematical modeling and high-performance computing to solve real-world scientific challenges.
